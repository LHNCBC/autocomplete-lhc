{"name":"Autocomplete-lhc","tagline":"An autocompleter package used by the PHR project and lforms widget","body":"# autocomplete-lhc\r\n\r\nThis is a package of JavaScript autocompleters based on PrototypeJS and\r\nScriptaculous.  These were originally developed to meet the requirements of the\r\n[NLM PHR project]\r\n(http://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/project/nlm-personal-health-record-phr).\r\nChanges from the Scriptaculous autocompleters:\r\n\r\n1. Supports coded-value lists\r\n1. Provides a way to get extra information about the record associated with a\r\nlist item.  (See recordDataRequester.js.)\r\n1. Numbered list items (optional).\r\n1. Two-column lists when there is not enough space on the page to show the list\r\nin a single column.\r\n1. Partial support for multi-select lists.  (Multi-select lists\r\ndo not currently support entry of text not on the list.)\r\n1. Support for list suggestions in the search (AJAX) autocompleter, when the user does\r\nnot pick an item in the list.\r\n1. Can require that an entry in the field match the list.\r\n1. Event listeners for various things like \"list selection\".\r\n1. \"autofill\" option -- fills in the field automatically if there is just one\r\nlist item\r\n1. Heading items in lists\r\n1. Default values (optional), which gets placed in the field when the field gets\r\nfocus (along with showing the list).\r\n1. A \"see more\" link on the search autocompleter which provides an expanded list\r\nof items.\r\n1. Search buttons (optional) for search autocompleters to make them show an expanded\r\nresults list.  (Without a button, the user can click on the \"see more\" link.)\r\n1. A results cache for the search autocompleter, so that repeats of AJAX calls\r\nfor the same list items are not necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis software, autocomp-phr, was developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\r\n\r\nPlease cite as: http://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/project/nlm-personal-health-record-phr\r\n\r\nThis software is distributed under a BSD-style open-source license.
