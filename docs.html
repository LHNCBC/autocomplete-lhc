        <h1></a>Documentation for autocomplete-lhc</h1>

        <p>The easiest way to get started is to check the <a
        href="index.html#demos">demos</a>.  Below each demo is a "show source" link that
        shows the code needed to construct an autocompleter with the options in the
        demo.  What follows here is detailed documentation for the various constructor
        options, list events (e.g. item selection) and the AngularJS directive.</p>

        <h2 id="construction">Constructing an Autocompleter</h2>

        <h3 id="construction_common">Options supported by both "search" (AJAX) and "prefetch"
        (non-AJAX) lists</h3>
        The constructors for both types of lists (Def.Autocompleter.Prefetch and
        Def.Autocompleter.Search) take an options argument as their third parameter.
        The following options are supported by both:

        <ul>
          <li>matchListValue - whether the field should validate its value
            against the list (default: false)</li>
          <li>maxSelect - (default 1) The maximum number of items that can be
           selected.  Use '*' for unlimited.</li>
          <li>twoColumnFlow - (default: true) Whether to allow long lists to
           flow into two columns to show more of the list on the page.</li>
          <li>suggestionMode - an integer specifying what type of suggestion
           should be offered based on what the user has typed.  The suggestion is placed
           as the top-most item in the list.  If this is not
           specified, the default is [Def.Autocompleter.]SUGGEST_SHORTEST, which
           means "pick the shortest match."  A value of
           NO_COMPLETION_SUGGESTIONS means no suggestions, and a value of
           USE_STATISTICS means that the suggestion is based on statistics, and
           that we will rely on the server to return the best item as the first
           item in the list.</li>
          <li>headerBar - If the page has a fixed-position element at the top of
           the page (e.g. a top navigation bar), the autocompleter needs to know
           that so that when scrolling to show the list it doesn't scroll the
           current
           field under the header bar.  This is the element ID for such a header
           bar.</li>
          <li>scrolledContainer - the element that should be scrolled to bring
           the list into view if it would otherwise extend below the edge of the
           window. The default is document.documentElement (i.e. the whole
           window).  This may be null if no scrolling is desired (e.g. if the
           list field is in a fixed position on the window), but in that
           case the list element might be unusually short.
           Note:  At present the only tested cases of this parameter are the
           default value and null.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="prefetch">Constructing a "prefetch" (non-AJAX) autocompleter</h3>
        A "prefetch" list gets its name from the having all of its list items
        "fetched" in advance, i.e. loaded with the page and not via AJAX,
        although it is possible to completely replace the list with another after the
        page loads (via the setListAndField method).  The syntax is as follows:

        <p><code>new Def.Autocompleter.Prefetch(fieldID, [array, of, items],
        options);</code></p>

        <div>Parameters:
          <ol>
            <li>the ID of the form field for which the list is displayed</li>
            <li>the array of completion options (list values).  If not
               specified here, the list can be supplied later by a call to the
               setListAndField function.</li>
            <li>(optional) an options hash, which can include:
              <ul>
                <li>any of the <a href="#construction_common">common options</a>
                  described above</li>
                <li>addSeqNum - whether sequence numbers should be added to the items
                    in the prefetched answer list (default true).</li>
                <li>defaultValue - Either the code or the item text of the default value
                 for this list's field.  The default value is placed in the
                 field the first time the user focuses the field.</li>
                <li>codes - an array of code strings for the list values, for use in
                  contexts where answer lists have associated codes which are relied on rather
                  than the display strings for the users.  This should
                  be the same length as the list values array.</li>
                <li>autoFill - If true, the field will be filled in with
                  the list's value if setListAndField is called with a one-item
                  list.</li>
                <li>itemToHeading - a hash of item codes to codes of item headings,
                 where both items and headings appear in the listItems array.  This
                 parameter requires that the codes parameter also be supplied.</li>
              <ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3 id="searchList">Constructing a "search" (AJAX) autocompleter</h3>
        A "search" list is an AJAX-based autocompleter, where AJAX requests
        return result lists which match the user's input in the field.  The
        syntax is as follows:

        <p><code>new Def.Autocompleter.Search(fieldID, url, options);</code></p>

        <div>Parameters:
          <ol>
            <li>the ID of the form field for which the list is displayed</li>
            <li id="url">url for getting the completion list.  The website answering the
             URL is expected to understand the following parameters:
              <ul>
                <li>terms - the text from the field.  This should be used to find
                 matching list items.</li>
                <li>autocomp - whether this is an autocompletion event, or a request
                 for a large list of search results (e.g. by using the "see more" link
                 on the list).  If autocomp==1, that means this is an autocompletion
                 request and the server should return a short list (e.g. 7 items) as
                 quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>authenticity_token - (optional) This is an anti-CSRF parameter.
                 If the page has a value in window._token, it will get sent in this
                 parameter.</li>
                <li>suggest - (optional) User input that does not match a list value
                 will trigger a request for suggestions that are close to what the
                 user typed.  A "suggest" parameter value of "1" means the request
                 is for suggestions.</li>
                <li>field_val - When "suggest"==1, this contains the value the user
                 typed.</li>
              </ul>
              The URL's response should be an array.  For a non-suggestion request
              (suggest != '1'), it should have the following elements:
              <ul>
                <li>position 0 - the total search result count (including the ones not
                 returned, if autocomp==1).</li>
                <li>position 1 - the list of codes for the list items (if the items are
                 coded)</li>
                <li id="extraData">position 2 - A hash of extra data about the list items (e.g.
                 an extra set of codes), or null if there is none.
                 The keys in the hash should be names for the
                 data elements, and the values should be an array of values, one for
                 each returned item.  Configuration controlling what gets returned here is out
                 of scope for this class; the search autocompleter just sends the
                 parameters above to the given URL.  The extra data for the selected item (when the
                 user makes a selection) can get be retrieved with
                 <a href="#getItemExtraData">getItemExtraData(itemText)</a>.</li>
                <li>position 3 - the list item data; each item is an array of display
                 string fields which will be joined together.  (At a mimimum, each item
                 should be an array of one string.)</li>
                <li>position 4 - if present, this indicates that display strings
                 (position 3) contain span tags for highlighting matched sub-strings.
                 (This affects the routine used to sort the strings.)</li>
              </ul>
              For a suggest request, the response should have the following elements:
              <ul>
                <li>position 0 - the list of codes for the suggested items (if the
                 items have codes)</li>
                <li>position 1 - the list of display strings (an array of strings, not
                 of arrays) for the suggested items.</li>
                <li>position 2 - A hash of extra data about the list items (the same
                 as position 2 for the non-suggestion request above.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(optional) an options hash, which can include:
              <ul>
                <li>any of the <a href="#construction_common">common options</a>
                 described above</li>
                <li>matchListValue - Whether the field value is required to be one from
                 the list (default: false).  When this field is false, for a
                 non-matching value a dialog will be shown with a list of suggestions
                 that are on the list-- unless that is disabled by setting
                 nonMatchSuggestions to false.</li>
                <li>buttonID - (optional) the ID of a button to initiate a search based on
                 the field's value.  This is useful if you do not want the field
                 to autocomplete (i.e. autocomp==false) but you still want to show a list of search
                 results in response to a button.</li>
                <li>autocomp - a boolean that controls whether the field should
                 also autocomplete as the user types.  When this is false, the user
                 won't see an autocompletion list until they hit return.  (Default:  true)</li>
                <li>nonMatchSuggestions - (default: true) Whether the user should be
                 given a list of suggestions if they enter a non-matching value.
                 This only applies when matchListValue is false.</li>
                <li>tableFormat - If true, then if the list's items contain
                 multiple fields, the list will be formatted in a table instead of just
                 concatenating the fields together for each list item.</li>
                <li>valueCols - Used when tableFormat is true to indicate
                 which columns in the table should be combined to form the field value
                 when the row is selected.  This should be an array of column indices
                 (starting with 0).  If absent, all columns will be combined for the
                 value.  Note that the specification here must result in unique field
                 values for each table row.</li>
                <li>useResultCache - (default: true) Whether or not the results
                 should be cached.  By default, the same cache is used for all fields that share
                 the same name, but that can be changed by overriding
                 Def.Autocompleter.getFieldLookupKey.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
        <p>The autocompleter allows you to register callbacks for certain
         events.  The source file <a
         href="https://github.com/lhncbc/autocomplete-lhc/blob/master/source/autoCompEvents.js"
         >autoCompEvents.js</a> provides the full list; here we'll just document
         the list selection event, which is the most likely to be useful.</a>

        <h3 id="listSelection">List Selection Events</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you might need to get notified when the user has picked a
         value from a list, or has entered a non-list value.  In that case you can
         register a callback like this:
        <p><code>Def.Autocompleter.Event.observeListSelections(fieldKey, callback);</code></p>

        <p>The parameters are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>fieldKey - This is usually the name (or ID) of the field, unless
              you have overridden Def.Observer.lookupKey (which you might do if you wanted the
              same callback to apply to multiple fields).  Fields whose lookupKey() value matches
              fieldKey will trigger the callback for this event.
              This parameter can be null, in which case the function will be called for every
              event of this kind, regardless of the field for which it
              occurred.</li>
            <li>callback - the function to be called when the event occurs.
              The function will be called with a hash argument with the following keys:
              <ul>
                <li>val_typed_in (what the user actually typed in)</li>
                <li>final_val (the final value for the field)</li>
                <li>used_list (boolean indicating whether or not the final was
                 selected from a list, whether by clicking or by arrows)</li>
                <li>on_list - boolean indicating whether or not the final value was on
                 the list</li>
                <li>input_method ('clicked', 'arrows', or 'typed')</li>
                <li>item_code - the code for the selected item, or null if there isn't
                 a code</li>
                <li>removed - For multi-select lists, this indicates whether the
                 selection was actual an unselection, removing the named item from the
                 list of selected items.  When true, final_val is the removed value
                 (although for multi-select fields the field is blank afterward).
                 (Optional; default false)</li>
                <li>list - the items that were in the list (which is the full list for a
                 prefetched list, or the portion shown to the user for a search
                 list).</li>
                <li>field_id - the ID of the list field</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="selectionData">Getting the selection data</h2>
        <p>For simple use cases, getting what the user picked is as simple as
          looking in the field.  For more complicated ones, APIs are provided
          for getting the code for the selected item, for getting selected items for
          multi-select lists (for which the field itself will be blank), and for getting
          the extra item data returned for a search list's AJAX call.  These
          APIs are defined on the autocompleter instance, and if you don't have a reference to
          that, you can access it from the field's DOM element as element.autocomp</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>getSelectedItems()</dt>
          <dd>Returns the display strings for the currently selected items or an
            empty array if there are none.</dd>
          <dt>getSelectedCodes()</dt>
          <dd>Returns the codes for the currently selected items or an empty
            array if there are none.
            If some of the selected items do not have a code, there will be null in
            that place in the returned array.</dd>
          <dt>getItemCode(itemText)</dt>
          <dd>Returns the code for the given item text, or null if there isn't
            one.</dd>
          <dt id="getItemExtraData">getItemExtraData(itemText)</dt>
          <dd><b>(For search lists only.)</b>This returns the "extra data" for
            the item returned by the server along with the autocompletion list,
            as mentioned in <a href="#extraData">position 2</a> of the expected
            return data for the <a href="#url">url parameter</a> for the
            <a href="#searchList">search autocompleter</a> constructor.  The
            getItemExtraData returns a hash of of the extra data for the given
            list item (itemText).  Currently, this assumes that itemText was present
            in the last list shown for this field; if subsequent autocompletion
            requests take place in which itemText is not present, the return
            value will be empty.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="directive">AngularJS Directive</h2>
        <p>If you are using AngularJS, you can set up your autocompleters via
          directive.  For example:</p>

        <p><code>&lt;input id="myfield" autocomplete-lhc="opts" ng-model="selectedVal"&gt;</code></p>

        <p>The opts object contains the options normally passed into the
         constructor.  As of version 8.0.0, the autocompleter will watch for
         changes to this object, so if you return it via a function call, the
         function should return the same object unless the options really change.
         As mentioned above, there are two types of autocompleters.  You can
         either have a "prefetch" list where all the items are given to the autocompleter
         at construction time, or a "search" list where the list items are discovered
         as the user types, via AJAX calls.  For both types, opts is a hash, but the
         keys on the hash differ.</p>

        <p>For "prefetched lists", opts can contain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>listItems - (required) This is the list item data.  It should be an array,
            and each element in the array should have a "text" property which is the
            display string the user sees.  The object containing that text property
            is what will get stored on the model you have associated via ng-model
            (selectedVal, in the example above).  So, if you wish you can have
            other properties holding data about each item, and the whole object gets placed
            in the model when the user selects an item.</li>
          <li>maxSelect - (default: 1) the maximum number of items that can be selected
            from the list.  If this is '*', an unlimited number can be selected.  When
            more than one item can be selected, selected items are stored in an array
            on the model (e.g., selectedVal in the example above becomes an array).</li>
          <li>defaultValue - The default value for the field.  This setting also exists in
            the non-directive prefetch lists, but there are two differences here:
            <ul>
              <li>defaultValue can either be one of the list item display strings (the
               "text" property), or it can be a hash like {code: 'AF-5'}, where "code" is
               a key on the list item object, and 'AF-5' is the value of that key
               to select the item as the default.  This is to allow the default value
               to be specified not just by the display string, but by other attributes
               of the list item object.</li>
              <li>the default list item is loaded into the field when the autocompletion
               is set up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <p>For "search" lists, opts can contain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>url - (required) The URL to which requests for data should be sent.  For
            details about expected query parameters and response data, see the
            comments for the <a href="#url">url</a> parameter for the
